                FROM PLAIN PROGRAMMIN TO BASIC OBJECT PROGRAMMING
				WITH MANY BUGS


This is a SECOND object-oriented version of the simple bug program.

The code for the "bug" has been encapsulated in an "object".

We create now nBugs bugs with

bugList = [0] * nBugs

for i in range(nBugs):
    aBug = Bug(i, random.randint(0,worldXSize-1), \
                            random.randint(0,worldYSize-1),
                            worldXSize, worldYSize)
    bugList[i] = aBug

Other form

bugList = []

for i in range(nBugs):
    aBug = Bug(i, random.randint(0,worldXSize-1), \
                            random.randint(0,worldYSize-1),
                            worldXSize, worldYSize)
    bugList.append(aBug)

Note that we do not need to memorize the identity of each bug, 
because we collect them in a list.
