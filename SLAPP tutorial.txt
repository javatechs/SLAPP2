		SIMPLEBUG SLAPP TUTORIAL

(You are supposed to have downloaded SLAPP as a zip file and to have unzipped it.)

SLAPP = Swarm-Like Agent Protocol in Python, by Pietro Terna,
https://github.com/terna/SLAPP

Swarm  = www.swarm.org
Python = www.python.org

This tutorial introduces the user through the development of aan agent-based
model  that makes use of a lot of the ideas of Swarm; ideas now rooted 
in the SLAPP structure.

The model refers to the movement of a bug, randomly walking in a 2D space.

We start introducing a very simple, essentially plain program, about
that bug taking a random walk. Through a progression of models,
we introduce basic object-oriented and Swarm style programming.

Although this is a quite simple exercise, it shows how
easy it is to compose fairly complex software from simple
building blocks.

In this folder, we have several subfolders, each with a complete
application and a README file that helps you to walk through the code.

You should start with the "1 plainProgrammingBug" folder, and then
proceed in the following order (the start files have a number correspondent
to that of their folder):

1 plainProgrammingBug
2 basicObjectProgrammingBug
3 basicObjectProgrammingManyBugs
4 basicObjectProgrammingManyBugs_bugExternal_+_shuffle
5 objectSwarmModelBugs
6 objectSwarmObserverAgents_AESOP_turtleLib_NetworkX
