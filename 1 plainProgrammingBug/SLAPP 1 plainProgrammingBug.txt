                   THE STARTING POINT

This is a simple program implemented in an extremely simple
way, with a plain programming style. 

It implements a "bug" taking a random walk. There is no 
"spatial" data-structure in this model, in which the "bug" lives. 
The xPos and yPos coordinates take simple random walks, modulo 
maximum X and Y values. Think of the bug taking a random walk
on a torus (enforced by the modulus ("%") operator.)

There is no object-oriented code here - and very little of Swarm.
This is just our starting point to develop the concept of Swarm
as we introduce Object Oriented and Swarm programming a little
bit at a time.
