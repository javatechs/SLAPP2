                FROM PLAIN PROGRAMMIN TO BASIC OBJECT PROGRAMMING
           WITH MANY BUGS, BUG AS AN EXTERNAL CLASS AND LIST SHUFFLING


This is a THIRD object-oriented version of the simple bug program.

The code for the "bug" has been encapsulated in an "object" and it is now 
reported in a separate file.

Bug collection is created as in the previous version; a special use of the 
list capabilities is shown, randomly shuffling the bug collection.
